    <div class="word"><h2>Amader choto nodi</h2>
    <p>Amader choto nodi chole bankebanke (Meandering, flows down our small river) â€¦." Educated Bengalee readers must have read these lines from a juvenile poem written by Rabindranath Tagore. In the poem, Tagore portrayed an idyllic picture of the rural river as it looks in summer. These rivers haven't vanished altogether from the greater Bengal. Many of them turn furious during monsoon. Their flood-fed width would expand fast amid nonstop downpours. This monsoon flooding leads to the devouring of the croplands and villages. The rivers during summer in the undivided Bengal remained more or less similar. The eastern part of the land, now Bangladesh, began witnessing weird behaviour of its rivers in the late-1970s. The untimely shrunken and overflowing, and thus, flood-triggering rivers became a common view in the country.</p> </div>
